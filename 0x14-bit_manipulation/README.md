# Bitwise manipulation

Is a way of manipulating with bits or to do operations at bits level (1,0 level)

C has special operators that do bitwise operations

|Name | Operator | number of operands|
| :------: | :------: | :------: | 
| AND| & | 2|
| OR| \||2|
NOT|~| 1|
LEFT SHIFT|<<|__|
RIGHT SHIFT|>>|__|
XOR|^|2|

***
`AND (&)`

The bitwise & operator takes two operands, converts the operands to bits and then does operations.

`At bit level & return 1 from both operands are 1 else 0`

- 4 & 6

    4 --> 100

    6 --> 110
    
    100 => 4
