# Dynamic libraries

also known as shared libraries.

These are libraries that are used by the program only when the need a raises. Unlike the static libraries that use up much of the computer's space or memory, shared libraries will only get loaded when a there is a program asking to use them.

In linux, shared libraries have the `.so` extension while in in Windows have `.dll` extension
